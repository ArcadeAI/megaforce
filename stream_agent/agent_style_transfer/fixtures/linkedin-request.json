The gap between what employers want and what candidates offer is widening.\n\nMy take: Focus on building end-to-end solutions, not just frontend or backend in isolation. The market rewards developers who can own the entire stack.\n\nWhat skills are you seeing most demand for in your network?\n\n#FullStackDevelopment #TechCareers #SoftwareEngineering #CareerGrowth"

The best results come from developers who understand the fundamentals and use AI to accelerate repetitive tasks.\n\nThoughts on how AI is changing your development process?\n\n#AIDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #TechTrends #Productivity"
